# ELECRec


Source code for paper: [ELECRec: Training Sequential Recommenders as Discriminators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02011.pdf)

Code releasing soon...


## Introduction

Motivation: 

Sequential recommendation is often considered as a generative task, i.e., training a sequential encoder to generate the next item of a userâ€™s interests based on her historical interacted items. Despite their prevalence, these methods usually require training with more meaningful samples to be effective, which otherwise will lead to
a poorly trained model.
